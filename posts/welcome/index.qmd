The project that I have decided to work on is analytics for the Madison High School football team. My job is to create a Logistic Regression to predict what contributes most to the team gaining 4 yards on each down. I will do this by collecting and analyzing unstructured video data of each football game and record that data into an excel sheet. The final presentation will be formatted in R-shiny. I will learn how to use R-shiny and further develop my skills in Logistic Regression. I will also develop my presentation skills so that I can present in a professional manner to the Madison High Schoolâ€™s football coach.

The new project that I have decided to work on is performing a Sentiment Analysis on restaraunt data. I have built the VADER algorithm which takes into account the weight of each word in a sentence and determines the positive, negative, and neutral percentage of the sentence or group of sentences. I have built a python script of the algorithm into Power BI and have created a dashboard for multiple restaraunts that I have web-scraped. The owner(s) can search for a specific word or sentence and find any review that matches. They also can see the positivity, negativity, and neutrality ratio of each Google review.
