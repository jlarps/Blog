My job is to create a Logistic Regression to predict what contributes most to the team gaining 4 yards on each down. I will do this by collecting and analyzing unstructured video data of each football game and record that data into an excel sheet. The final presentation will be formatted in R-shiny. I will learn how to use R-shiny and further develop my skills in Logistic Regression. I will also develop my presentation skills so that I can present in a professional manner to the Madison High Schoolâ€™s football coach.\n\n![](thumbnail.jpg)\n\nSecond Blog Post:\n\nThe new project that I have decided to work on is performing a Sentiment Analysis on restaraunt data. I have built the VADER algorithm which takes into account the weight of each word in a sentence and determines the positive, negative, and neutral percentage of the sentence or group of sentences. I have built a python script of the algorithm into Power BI and have created a dashboard for multiple restaraunts that I have web-scraped. The owner(s) can search for a specific word or sentence and find any review that matches. They also can see the positivity, negativity, and neutrality ratio of each Google review.\n\nThird Blog Post:\n\nI have built a scheduled unattended bot using Power Automate to navigate through the Google Reviews API to collect new restaurant data reviews and upload it into a csv file and store it into the data folder. This will allow my client to refresh the data set in Power BI automatically from the online end."},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":true,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","css":["../../styles.css"],"output-file":"index.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"quarto-version":"1.2.313","theme":"cosmo","title-block-banner":true,"title":"Welcome To My Blog","author":"Jared Arp","date":"2023-01-27","categories":["news"]},"extensions":{"book":{"multiFile":true}}}}}
